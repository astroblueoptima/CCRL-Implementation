# Causal-Consequential Reinforcement Learning (CCRL) 🌱

Unlock the potential of your AI models with the novel CCRL method. By blending causal understanding with predictive analysis, CCRL provides a holistic approach to decision-making in complex environments.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Predictive Analysis**: Anticipates future outcomes based on past experiences.
- **Causal Understanding**: Builds a model of the environment's causal structure to understand why things happen.
- **Holistic Approach**: Combines forward-looking predictions with deep analytical insights.
- **Versatility**: Tailored for a variety of environments, from simple to complex.
